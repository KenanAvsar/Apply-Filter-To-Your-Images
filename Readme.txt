‚å®Ô∏è üñ±Ô∏è I used the OpenCV library in the Python language. In the application, you select a filter on the live image taken from the photo, video or webcam and apply that filter to the image you give to the application. In order to do this, I created the filters using the OpenCV library and applied them to the image when we select the filters.



üñ•Ô∏è I used the Hugging Face platform to make the change in images more useful on a user basis. I created an interface to use in Hugging Face and transferred the codes here. Here I have created a simple example of filter applications that we use in our electronic devices such as our phones or computers.
